title: AI Is Plastic
---

Plastic won. People complain about it, but it unlocked access to things that used to be out of reach. It made products cheaper, more available, and more disposable. It spread everywhere because it was good enough.

AI feels the same. It is inferior to handcrafted human work with current tech, and that is obvious to anyone who cares about craft. It still gets used because it covers the majority of use cases at a fraction of the cost. It makes things faster, cheaper, and more available, and that wins.

There is no need for AI to match the best human output. It only needs to be good enough for most people, most of the time. That is the reality of how tools get adopted in the real world.

I think it will replace plenty of work we used to hold dear. Many things built by people will be swapped for something cheaper. That's ok. You can hate that, or you can recognize the shape of the wave.

Plastic will outlive all of us and most of everything we make. Most likely AI will follow the same path.
