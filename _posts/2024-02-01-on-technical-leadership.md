title: On technical leadership

Technical leadership is less about having the loudest opinions and more about creating momentum. The best leads I know make direction feel obvious, even when the path is ambiguous.

A few habits that have served me well:

- Write down decisions, tradeoffs, and open risks so the team can align quickly.
- Make space for dissent, then close loops with a clear call.
- Look for leverage points: automation, docs, and shared primitives.
- Model calm when the system is noisy. It spreads.

Over time, these small practices compound into trust. That trust is what allows teams to move fast without breaking things.
