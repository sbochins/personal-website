title: AI Personas
---

I keep seeing teams lean on AI personas as if they are a substitute for sound engineering practice. The pattern is familiar: line up a "Product Manager," "Senior Engineer," and "QA" persona and let them talk it out. As much as I hate to admit it, I get the appeal. It feels like you are recreating a product team in a chat window. In practice, it rarely leads to better work.

The core issue is simple: the model already has the capabilities those personas claim to represent. You do not get a smarter plan because you told the model to be a "Product Manager." You get a different tone. Maybe a different format. But you do not get new knowledge, better reasoning, or a magically realistic process. You get the same model, wearing a different hat.

People mistake narrative for rigor. The conversation feels more structured, but the output quality doesn't materially change.

Watching my kids play makes the analogy hard to unsee. They line up dolls, assign roles, and act out a story where each one has a job. It's creative and fun. It also doesn't constrain anything. The story works because they want it to work.

AI personas operate similarly. The model is improvising. You are steering tone and format. The thinking stays the same. If the "Architect" tells the "Engineer" to "consider scalability," that does not mean scalability got real analysis. It means the model wrote the word "scalability."

Agents and subagents can be valuable when they help manage context. They let you isolate a slice of the problem, preserve key details, and reduce the amount of irrelevant stuff the model has to juggle. That's real leverage.

Most "persona" workflows skip the context management part and default to story and role-play.

You can see this clearly in "vibe coding" a website by spinning up a fake product team. Product Manager persona for requirements, Software Architect persona for system design, Software Engineer persona for implementation, QA persona for testing. It's theater. The model already has those capabilities, and it's the same model in each step. You created a script.

If you want better output, focus on what actually changes the model's behavior. Provide tighter context, ask for constraints, break work into smaller, concrete steps, and specify the format and trade-offs you care about. That is how you reduce hallucinations and improve outcomes.

If you like personas because they help you think, fine. But call it what it is: a prompt style. If you want real leverage, invest in context management and decomposition. It's less fun than pretending your AI is a team, but it's far more effective.

At some point, you have to decide whether you want a story or a result. The dolls are great for play. They are not great for real work. I still think the simple stuff works best, even if it's not as fancy or impressive.
