title: Another Round, Another Agent
---

Another Round follows teachers who experiment with drinking to see if it makes them better at their jobs, chasing a kind of [Balmer Peak](https://xkcd.com/323/) effect. It works for a bit. Then it slides into dependency and one of them dies.

That arc feels familiar in the way people use AI agents. A little help can make you faster and sharper. Too much, too often, without discipline, and you stop noticing what you no longer understand. It feels productive right up until it fails.

Anything the AI writes still has your name on it. You own the code. That means testing it, reviewing it the way you would review a colleague, and understanding what it does. It is easy to accept changes without the full context or the long tail of consequences. That is how you end up in trouble.

The movie ends in tragedy because they keep chasing the feeling instead of owning the risk. Agent use can drift the same way. Discipline is the difference between a tool and a habit you cannot control.
