I build software with an emphasis on clarity, durability, and pragmatic design. Over the years I've focused on large-scale systems, developer platforms, and the craft of shipping tools that teams can rely on.

This site will evolve into a small archive of lessons learned, thoughtful takes on engineering, and a record of projects I care about.
